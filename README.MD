# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple attempt at creating a rock-paper-scissors browser-based application.
The goal of this project is to practice new javascript concepts learned in The Odin-project, as well as some of the previously learned HTML and CSS.

### Future plans

I plan on revisiting all of these projects in the future once I get to the end of the entire course as a way to document the process. My main goal for this one was to be able to use it on a mobile device(although I'm sure that's included later in the course). While I'm no designing artist, it was fun to revisit some of the CSS and HTML topics and I am looking forward to improving along the way.
